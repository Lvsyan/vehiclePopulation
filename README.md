Hello everyone, thanks for watching this project, I would appreciate to have some feedback to keep learning how to use Powerbi.

I had one question in mind where:
What have we discovered by doing it? Trends, outliers, evidence that has been discovered through analysis that was not so evident at the beginning

By watching this dashboard we can realize that Tesla is the Company with most electric cars in the world.

I made some graphics to see in which year we got more vehicles and tops of companies.

Thank you so much
