# Description

This dashboard is being made for an exercise of a specialization about Business Intelligence

## Filters

I've only used a filter where you can choose the year, from that we can already realize some points with the graphics that we have

## Dashboard

Compañías por país con  vehículos eléctricos -> these are the companies of the vehicles for each country

Rango eléctrico por Año -> Range of electric range per year

Tipo de vehículos eléctricos -> type of vehicles through every year

Coches eléctricos por año por Compañia -> cars per year of compoanies through the years

Coche eléctrico por marca -> car per branch

Tipos de vehiculos -> type of vehicles being this case battery electric or hybrid

## Conclusion

What have we discovered by doing it? Trends, outliers, evidence that has been discovered through analysis that was not so evident at the beginning

By watching this dashboard we can realize that Tesla is the Company with most electric cars in the world.

I made some graphics to see in which year we got more vehicles and tops of companies.

## Programs

- Excel 2016

- PowerBI

## Feedback

I got the excel dataset from Kaggle that I think is deleted because I don't find it
